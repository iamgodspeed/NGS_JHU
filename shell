3.single splice variant
cut -f1 apple.genes | sort | uniq -c | grep " 1 " | wc -l

4.multiple splice variants
cut -f1 apple.genes | sort | uniq -c | grep -v " 1 " | wc -l

5.how many genes on "+" or "-" strand

section 2
1.how many alignment in bam
samtools flagstat x.bam
samtools view x.bam | wc -l
samtools view x.bam | cut -f3 | grep -v "*" | wc -l

2.how many alignment shows mate unmapped (mapped)
samtools view x.bam | cut -f7 | grep "*" | wc -l ("=")

3.how many alignments contain Deletion(spliced)
samtools view x.bam | cut -f6 | grep D | wc -l (N)

extract chromosome position:

samtools sort x.bam x.sorted (generate x.sorted.bam)
samtools index x.sorted.bam (generate x.sorted.bam.bai)
samtools view –b x.sorted.bam “Chr3:1000-2000” > x.subset.bam

11-15
11.how many sequences
samtools view -H x.bam | grep "SN:" | wc -l

12.length of the first sequence
samtools view -H x.bam | grep "SN:" | more

13.aligner was used
samtools view –H x.bam | grep “^@PG” (^start of the line)

14.id of the first sequence
samtools view x.bam | head -1 | cut -f1

15.start position of mate
samtools view x.bam | head -1 | cut -f7,8

16-20
16.how many overlaps
bedtools intersect -abam x.bam -b x_annot.gtf -bed -wo > overlaps.bed
-abam
-bed

17.how many these overlaps are longer than 10 bases
cut –f22 overlaps.bed | sort –nrk1 > lengths

18.how many alignments overlap annotation
cut -f1-12 overlaps.bed | sort -u | wc -l
The minimum information needed to define the alignments is contained in columns 1-5
which include the read ID and the flag
specifying whether this is read 1 or read 2 in a pair with the same read ID).

19.how many exons overlap alignments
cut -f13-21 overlaps.bed | sort -u | wc -l

20.how many transcripts in annotation.gtf (in BED file, each line = 1 transcript)
cut -f9 x_annot.gtf | cut -d ' ' -f1,2 |  sort -u
